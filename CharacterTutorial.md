# Realistic Character Controller

As the name suggests this will be a first-person character controller.

In Unity set up a Ground plane first. Then set the layer to "Ground". If you do not have a ground layer you can add one by clicking Layer -> Add Layer -> name a new layer "Ground".
         Add a video for layer setup


Make an Empty Object, name it Player, and add the Character Controller Component to it.
Within the component change the Height to 3.6
